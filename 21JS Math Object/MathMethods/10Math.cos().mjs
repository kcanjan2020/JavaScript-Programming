// Math.cos() Method:
//=> Math.cos(x) returns the cosine (a value between -1 and 1) of the angle x(given in radians)
//=> if we want to use degree instead of radians, we have to convert degree to radian:
//=> Angle in radian= Angle in degrees*PI/180

console.log(Math.cos(0)); //1
console.log(Math.cos((0 * Math.PI) / 180)); //1
