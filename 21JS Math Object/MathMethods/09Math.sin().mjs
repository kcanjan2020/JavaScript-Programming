// Math.sin() Method:
//=> Math.sin(x) returns the sine (a value between -1 and 1) of the angle x(given in radians)
//=> if we want to use degree instead of radians, we have to convert degree to radian:
//=> Angle in radian= Angle in degrees*PI/180

console.log(Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)); //1 => Angle in Radian
console.log(Math.sin((90 * Math.PI) / 180)); //1 =>Angle in Degree
