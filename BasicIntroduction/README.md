# How to Use JavaScript
There are several ways to use JavaScript, including:

1. In the browser: Most modern browsers have a JavaScript console that you can use to test and run your code.

2. In HTML: You can add JavaScript to your HTML files and run it in the browser. This is a great way to add interactivity to your website.

3. With a runtime environment: One popular runtime environment for JavaScript is Node.js. Node.js was created when a programmer named Ryan Dahl took Google's V8 JavaScript engine and wrapped it in C++. This allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, which is useful for server-side programming.
